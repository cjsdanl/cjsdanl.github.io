Let's analyze the `starwars` data: :star:

```


```{r}

## Variable Description for `starwars` data.frame

The following describes the variables in the `starwars` data.frame.


- `films`
List of films the character appeared in

- `name`
Name of the character

- `species`
Name of species

- `height`
Height (cm)

- `mass`
Weight (kg)

- `hair_color`, `skin_color`, `eye_color`
Hair, skin, and eye colors

- `birth_year`
Year born (BBY = Before Battle of Yavin)

- `sex`
The biological sex of the character, namely male, female, hermaphroditic, or none (as in the case for Droids).

- `gender`
The gender role or gender identity of the character as determined by their personality or the way they were programmed (as in the case for Droids).

- `homeworld`
Name of homeworld


## Human vs. Droid

```{r}
ggplot(data = 
         starwars %>% 
         filter(species %in% c("Human", "Droid"))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = mass, 
                   fill = species),
               show.legend = FALSE)

# Variable Description for starwars ---------------------------------------

# The following describes the variables 
# in the `starwars` data.frame.

# films: List of films the character appeared in
# name: Name of the character
# species: Name of species
# height: Height (cm)
# mass: Weight (kg)
# hair_color, skin_color, eye_color: Hair, skin, and eye colors
# birth_year: Year born (BBY = Before Battle of Yavin)
# sex: The biological sex of the character, 
# namely male, female, hermaphroditic, or none (as in the case for Droids).
# gender: The gender role or gender identity of the character 
# as determined by their personality or 
# the way they were programmed (as in the case for Droids).
# homeworld: Name of homeworld


# Answer for Q2b
starwars[ starwars$species == "Droid", ]
  #18 characters


# Answer for Q2c
#q2c <- prop.table( table( DATA.FRAME$VARIABLE ) )
q2c <- prop.table( table( starwars$films ) )
q2c <- table(starwars$name)
q2c
  #R2-D2

# Answer for Q2d
summary(starwars$height)
  #minimum- 66
  #1st quartile- 167
  #median- 178
  #3rd quartile- 188
  #maximum- 264
    #the median value is different from the mean because the median
      #puts all the heights in numerical order and chooses the middle
      #value, where the mean leaves the values as they are placed
    # the median is greater than the mean when the distribution is skewed to the left
    #the mean is greater than the median when the distribution is skewed to the right

# Q2e --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide the R code to find the number of unique/distinct 
# `homeworld` values.

# Answer for Q2e
unique_homeworlds <- unique(starwars$homeworld)
print(unique_homeworlds)


# Question 3. Data Visualization with gapminder ----------------------------


# Q3a ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide the R code to install the R package, `gapminder`.

# Answer for Q3a
install.packages("gapminder")


# Q3b ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Load the `gapminder` data.frame provided by the R package, 
# `gapminder`.

# Answer for Q3b
library('gapminder')



# Variable Description for gapminder data.frame ------------------------------

# The following describe the variables in the `gapminder` data.frame.

# `country`
# factor with 142 levels

# `continent`
# factor with 5 levels

# `year`
# ranges from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years

# `lifeExp`
# life expectancy at birth, in years

# `pop`
# population

# `gdpPercap`
# GDP per capita (US$, inflation-adjusted)




# Q3c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# the relationship between `gdpPercap` and `lifeExp`.

# Answer for Q3c
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))



# Q3d ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# how the relationship between `gdpPercap` and `lifeExp` 
# varies by `continent`.

# Answer for Q3d
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent))
